<h1>Application Notes</h1><p>This document contains miscellaneous supplemental documentation for CoreMIDI.
(Last updated October 2002).</p><a name="Displayofendpointnames"></a>
<h2>Display of endpoint names</h2><p>Here is the recommended algorithm for display of a <a href="../Reference/MIDIServices.html#MIDIEndpointRef"><tt>MIDIEndpointRef</tt></a>'s name.</p><p>Get the endpoint's <a href="../Reference/MIDIServices.html#kMIDIPropertyConnectionUniqueID"><tt>kMIDIPropertyConnectionUniqueID</tt></a> property.</p><p>If the endpoint has exactly one connected external device, display the
external device's name.</p><p>If the endpoint has multiple connected external devices, there are several 
possibilities depending on the context:</p><ul>
<li>Attempt to choose exactly one device to display (e.g. if the context involves
events on only one MIDI channel, and only one of the devices receives on that channel,
it's clearly reasonable to display only that device)</li>
<li>Concatenate the names of all of the devices, separated by commas (some special
characters such as slashes and dashes are common in device names)</li>
<li>Display the physical MIDI port's name (as below)</li>
</ul><p>If an endpoint has no connected external devices, display the endpoint's name,
which will normally be inherited from its entity's name:</p><ul>
<li>If the name obtained in this manner is an empty string, use <a href="../Reference/MIDIServices.html#MIDIEntityGetDevice"><tt>MIDIEntityGetDevice</tt></a>
to obtain the device and use the device's name.  (This works around a bug
in some versions of the AppleMIDIUSB driver.)</li>
<li>If the name obtained in this manner is not unique among the other sources or
destinations in the system, or, if your application has sufficient screen space
to display long names, prepend the device's name and a space to the endpoint's name.</li>
</ul><a name="Virtualdestinationsandscheduledevents"></a>
<h2>Virtual destinations and scheduled events</h2><p>Creators of virtual destinations are encouraged to interpret MIDI System Reset
messages (0xFF) as a command to flush all pending, previously-scheduled events.</p><p>Clients which send to virtual destinations are encouraged to send MIDI System
Reset messages to do this.</p><p>A future implementation of MIDIEndpointFlush may send this message to a virtual
destination.</p></body>
