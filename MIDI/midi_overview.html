<a name="History"></a>
<h2>History</h2><p>Apple's MIDI Manager (ca. 1990) had a simple model of the world.  There were
application and driver clients, which had MIDI in/out ports, which could be
interconnected in arbitrary ways.  This model failed to provide a way for
applications to make reasonable assumptions about how to make bi-directional
connections to a MIDI device.  MIDI Manager also had limitations on the
number of ports per client, and became very unwieldy with the advent of
large studios and multi-port MIDI interfaces such as the MIDI Time Piece and
Studio 5.</p><p>Opcode's OMS (1991) addressed some of the shortcomings of MIDI Manager. 
There was the concept of a studio setup document, where drivers detected
their devices, and the user could define the characteristics of additional
devices connected to the MIDI ports. Applications could view the studio both
as a collection of MIDI source and destination "nodes", but also as a
collection of devices.  OMS collected information about, and made available
to its clients, useful characteristics of the devices in the studio, such as
their system-exclusive IDs, MIDI channels on which they were listening,
which were controllers (as opposed to simple tone generators), etc.</p><a name="APIOverview"></a>
<h2>API Overview</h2><p>This design expands slightly on OMS's device/node hierarchy, inspired by the
USB MIDI spec.</p><p>Drivers own and control devices, e.g. USB interfaces, PCI cards, etc.  A
device is defined as a physical object that would be represented by a single
icon if there were a graphical view of the studio.</p><p>Devices may have multiple logically distinct sub-components, e.g. a MIDI
synthesizer and a pair of MIDI ports, both addressable via a USB port. 
These are called Entities.</p><p>Entities have any number of Endpoints, sources and destinations of
16-channel MIDI streams.  By grouping a device's endpoints into entities,
the system has enough information for an application to make reasonable
assumptions about how to communicate in a bi-directional manner with each
entity, as is necessary in MIDI librarian applications.</p><p>Drivers add standard properties to the devices/entities/endpoints they
create, and may also set additional private properties on them for their
own use.</p><p>Using the Audio MIDI Setup application, users may define "external" devices,
devices which are connected to a driver-owned device (such as a MIDI interface)
via a traditional MIDI cable.  Users may then define the properties of these
external devices using CoreMIDI's central database of the current state.</p><p>It's worth noting that some device characteristics are dynamic
(e.g. MIDI receive channel and system-exclusive ID's), or a matter of user
preference (choice of icon, whether the device should appear in lists of
possible controllers), while other properties are static and could be looked
up in a database, using the device's manufacturer and model names as a key.</p><a name="Persistentconfigurations/DeviceInformation"></a>
<h2>Persistent configurations / Device Information</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why CoreMIDI has a persistent state.</p><p>Endpoints must have persistent ID's.  When a user assigns events in a
sequencing application to an endpoint, the application needs a way to retain
a permanent reference to the selected endpoint.  A brute-force method of
generating a persistent ID would be to combine the driver name, device name,
entity name, and endpoint type and index into a string, but this is not very
friendly to clients even if the system provides services to generate and
decode these strings.</p><p>Consider a USB MIDI interface driver, in the case where there are two
instances of one model of interface present.  The driver needs a way to
permanently distinguish, to the system and its clients, between the two
interfaces.  Which is #1 and which is #2? If #1 gets unplugged, #2 should
not automatically become #1; the user's documents may be referring to
devices which were attached to #2.</p><p>These needs for persistent configuration information provide a rationale for
having something akin to OMS's studio setup document, a saved configuration
for the system. Mobile users who work in multiple environments could select
between multiple saved configurations in a Location Manager-compatible
manner.</p><p>Given services with which to store driver configuration information, we then
have built the groundwork for a client studio setup editor application. 
Such an application can define external MIDI devices (not to
be confused with the driver-owned cards/ interfaces/etc whose presence in
the configuration is determined by the driver).</p><p>Moreover, since a driver knows exactly what device it is communicating with,
it is capable of supplying information to the system about the
characteristics of the device, such as its system-exclusive ID, whether it
is General MIDI or DLS-compatible, etc.</p><p>But unlike OMS, the system is able to begin functioning immediately,
using only the MIDI devices/endpoints detected by the drivers, without
forcing the user to go through a somewhat lengthy and confusing intial
configuration process. Definition of external MIDI devices can be a
completely optional step, only made possible when a client application
requests that they be added to the configuration.</p><a name="Implementationoverview"></a>
<h2>Implementation overview</h2><p>The client API is implemented as the CoreMIDI framework, which uses IPC to
communicate with a server process, MIDIServer.</p><p>The server process loads, and manages all communication with, MIDI drivers.
Most of its implementation is in the CoreMIDIServer framework, which drivers 
may link against in order to access the API.</p><p>"Drivers" are not I/O Kit drivers.  They are dynamic libraries, packaged as
CFPlugins.</p><p>Many MIDI drivers can simply be user-side I/O Kit clients (probably for
serial, USB, Firewire).</p><p>PCI card drivers will need their MIDI drivers to communicate with a separate
kernel extension.</p><a name="NoteaboutCoreFoundationdatatypes(CFString,CFData,CFDictionary)"></a>
<h2>Note about CoreFoundation data types (CFString, CFData, CFDictionary)</h2><p>When passing a CF object to a MIDI function, the MIDI function will never
consume a reference to the object; the caller always retains a reference
which it is responsible for releasing with CFRelease().</p><p>When receiving a CF object as a return value from a MIDI function, the caller
always receives a new reference to the object, and is responsible for
releasing it.</p><a name="VersionHistory"></a>
